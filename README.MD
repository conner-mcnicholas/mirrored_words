I recently took a sidequest to determine my max typing speed (220 WPM as it turns out), and during that exercise I wondered whether or not my left hand or right hand were faster (I'm naturally right handed, but having played guitar for most of my life - which has developed an extreme left-handed dexterity not dissimilar from typing).  

So I wrote a script to find instances wherein 2 words require the same keystrokes, except mirroring left and right hand responsibilities           
	(i.e. 'p' corresponds with 'q', 'f' corresponds with 'j', etc)

If I could find some heavily "handed" words, meaning using mostly left or right hands, my relative speed disparity within the pair those could be used as a proxy for my typing speed handedness generally. 

## SUMMARY

The longest word pairings were discovered to be shared between the pairs: ("crudest" & "murkily") and ("lessest" & "sillily").  The mirror quality of which is illustrated below for the former, both both pairs share the pattern of being favored (6:1 left, 6:1 right).

I executed the following 2 tests, and was faster at the second, proving that my guitar training was not enough to overcome my innate right handedness.

	L-Hand: "crudest lessest crudest lessest crudest lessest crudest lessest crudest lessest"
	R-Hand: "murkily sillily murkily sillily murkily sillily murkily sillily murkily sillily"

### SOME HIGHLIGHTED MIRRORED PAIRS

Many of the words in the result files are extremely esoteric, so I curated the following set of commonly used words.
